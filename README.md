# dylans-banking-system
Project for bootcamp
This is a simple project, with cut functions to make sure it gets uploaded.

Run the "run_here.py" file and it will ask you to input text to the console.

The main features:
It has logging, which writes a timestamped file to a different folder.
PEP8 compliant for the large part
Exception handling is implemented and ties to logs
The code is mostly readable but un-commented as I need to move on for time

To use-
Simply run the run here, and type in console. You can only create objects in the Banking system,
or list them. Other functions were cut for time.
